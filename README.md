# MQTT-IoT
This repo contains the final project for the TC1001S course.

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION
We are using MQTT for an IoT project. The main objective is to read in real time the data collected by a temperature and a humidity sensor and display those values in the console. 

### SOFTWARE
It uses the software Arduino for the functionality of the NodeMCU and the sending of the information using MQTT.

### TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS
For this project we used Arduino, for the connection we created an Instance using the Amazon EC2 in AWS, and GitHub for the hosting of our project.

### MATERIALS
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Humidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Protoboard
- Wires

### MQTT
Back-end system that coordinates messages between different clients.
