# MQTT-IoT
This repo contains the final project for the TC1001S course.

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION
We are using MQTT for an IoT project. The main objective is to read in real time the data collected by a temperature and a humidity sensor and display those values in the console. 

<br>

### SOFTWARE
It uses the software Arduino for the functionality of the NodeMCU and the sending of the information using MQTT.

Besides, Mosquitto was implemented for this project. Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1 and 3.11. It is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low power single board computers to full servers

<br>

### TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS
For this project we used Arduino, for the connection we created an Instance using the Amazon EC2 in AWS, and GitHub for the hosting of our project.

<br>

### MATERIALS
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Humidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Protoboard
- Wires

<br>

### MQTT
Back-end system that coordinates messages between different clients.
